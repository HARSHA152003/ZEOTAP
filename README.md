### 1. **Database Setup**
   - A MySQL database named `rule_engine` is created to store rules.
     - **`rules`**: Stores the rule strings and their corresponding Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).
   (The SQL queries are saved in a file named `Database Query.txt` for easy reference and execution.)

### 2. **PHP Backend**
   - **Database Connection (`db.php`)**: Establishes a connection to the MySQL database using PHPâ€™s MySQLi extension.
   - **AST Node Class (`Node.php`)**: Defines the structure of nodes in the AST, which represents logical expressions.
   - **Rule Parser (`create_rule.php`)**: Parses rule strings into ASTs and stores them in the database, allowing for dynamic rule creation.
   - **Rule Combination (`combine_rules.php`)**: Combines multiple ASTs based on user-provided rule IDs, enabling more complex rule evaluations.
   - **Rule Evaluation (`evaluate_rule.php`)**: Evaluates rules against JSON data, providing real-time results based on user input.

### 3. **Frontend Interface**
   - A simple HTML page serves as the user interface for interacting with the backend. It includes forms for:
     - Creating new rules
     - Listing existing rules
     - Combining rules
     - Evaluating rules
     - Modifying rules

### Advantages of Using PHP
- **Server-Side Processing**: PHP is designed for server-side scripting, making it ideal for handling backend logic and database interactions seamlessly.
- **Ease of Use**: PHP has a simple syntax and a large community, making it easier to implement complex functionalities without extensive overhead.
- **Integration with MySQL**: PHP integrates well with MySQL, providing efficient data manipulation and retrieval capabilities, which is crucial for this rule engine.
- **Dynamic Content Generation**: PHP can dynamically generate HTML content based on user inputs and database queries, enhancing the user experience.
- **Rich Ecosystem**: With a variety of libraries and frameworks available, PHP allows for rapid development and deployment of web applications.
